longForm: You enter the large kitchen. Many stone tables, stoves, and racks line the walls and floor. Much space was needed for the large feasts held in the Great Hall. One ~Ftable~E in particular is a bloody mess. A ~Fstove~E looks like it was recently lit. On the west side of the room you notice a cellar door leading down to the ~RWine Cellar~E. Back east is the entrance to the ~RGreat Hall~E, and to the south is the ~RServants Quarters~E. Many of the servants must have been stationed in the kitchen.
